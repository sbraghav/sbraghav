Chess.com has little control over the rules of chess. The laws of the game have been the same for the last few centuries. Yet,  how does chess.com provide a superior experience to its users?

A look into the player base of chess.com hints us into some of the problems that the users face. Check out the rating distribution of all players in chess.com. The majority of the player base has a rating of less than 1000.

A large majority of these players are amateurs who play chess for fun. The games played by them are with a time control of less than 10 minutes per side. A player falling under this segment may never intend to play a professional chess tournament in his lifetime.

Players in this segment face a major roadblock. Once their ratings plateau at a point and it would be very difficult for them to move up the rating ladder from there on. Over a period of time, a lack of progress in ratings may make them feel like they are not making any progress and playing online is just futile.

Rating plateaus can be demotivating. Players play less and less of chess before they eventually stop. How to keep users engaged in their game when their progress plateaus due to their skill level?


Chess.com came up with this concept of rewarding activity by offering something for its most active users. The top N players with most wins get promoted to higher division. The player's current division is shown as a flair in their profile page. Competition among its active users ensures that they continue to stay active and play a lot of games.

A simple way of letting the most active users compete against each other can
* Makes active users play more games
* Retains active users and prevent them from moving to other chess sites.

Game mechanics seem to be an interesting topic since it utilizes the intrinsic motivation and psychology to incentivize certain kinds of behaviours within the game. Would write more on game mechanics in the upcoming posts.
